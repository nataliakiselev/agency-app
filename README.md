## Description

This is the front-end of a full-stack (MERN) application. Written in React it makes use of router, React context (as the state management solution) and Auth with JWT. The back end can be found here: https://github.com/Nat-K/agency-app
To test the whole spectrum of the app functionality login is necessary (logged-in users can add new profiles, and profile owner (agent) can edit or delete a profile). An agent login for test demo: email: test@img.com, password: test1111
To create a new user which will be able to create and handle new profiles, the "register" option should be used from the login menu.
